**if :**

it depends on your internet connection and your pc 👍

****Note**** : if you have good internet connection (7mbps +) you could decrease the sleep time for 7+ tokens **:)**

but for most of the pcs this is the right choice :

**
token count = 1-5  --->  sleep time = 4-7

token count = 5-10  --->  sleep time = 9-12

token count = 10-17  --->  sleep time = 12-15

token count = 17+  --->  sleep time = 15+**
